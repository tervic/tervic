--->Hi, I'm @tervic,
I am not exactly a newbie but have seldom engaged with community development.

My interest is mostly directed at seeing of I can develop an understanding of ML as applicable to molecular dynamics simulations.
This is primarily a 'retirement' project to enjoy the freedom to explore something no longer duty bound to pursue others goals.
